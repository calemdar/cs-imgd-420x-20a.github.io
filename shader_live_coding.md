# Assignment 2 - Shader Live Coding

- Create a one-minute or longer animation using Shawn Lawson's [The Force](https://shawnlawson.github.io/The_Force/) environment. Your animation can be through-composed (no interaction) by relying on the the `time` uniform, or performed via live-coding or other interaction techniques (mouse etc.). 

- Write a paragraph (150–200 words) that describes your aesthetic intent and what you were interested in exploring technically. I encourage you to focus on simple ideas (dots, grids, etc.), although a crescendo that peaks with total pixel chaos is always tempting... 

- Play your animation for a classmate (this can be coordinated via Slack). Write a paragraph that describes the feedback of your classmate and whether or not it matched your expectations... and of course it's totally fine if it doesn't match them (and possibly much more interesting!). Feel free to include feedback from addition classmates / other people if you like, but only one source of feedback is required.

- Create a webpage containing a link to your video (hosted at a permanent location such as Vimeo or Youtube), your shader code (this can be a link to a GitHub file or you can inline it on the page), your summary paragraph, and the paragraph about the feedback you received. Add a link to this webpage from your personal course website (and make sure you've done the pull request in the onboarding assignment if you haven't already).  

Grading Rubric
---
- 10% Posted to your personal course website correctly, with video in permanent hosting location
- 10% Summary paragraph concisely explains technical and aesthetic goals
- 10% Paragraph describing feedback received and how it met / didn't meet your expectations
- 50% Use of a variety of different GLSL functions (at least 10, experiment!)
- 10% Development of piece throughout one minute... how does it change over time?
- 10% Visual Aesthetics. Is there a discernible theme in the work? What constraints are in place (limited color-palette, limited number of shapes etc.)? 

This assignment will count for 10–12.5% of your final grade, depending on whether we do four or five assignments in the course. Please take time to ensure that spelling / grammar are correct and that the assignment is linked / posted / hostted correctly so that you don't lose any easy points.

You might consider these classic abstract animations that we watched in class as sources of inspiration for doing a formal study:
